# SAHASTA - Sahabat Gizi Anak Untuk Cegah Stunting (C242-PS191)

SAHASTA is a digital innovation designed to address the pressing issue of stunting in Indonesia. By leveraging the power of technology, this project aims to empower health workers at Integrated Service Posts (Posyandu) in rural areas to provide better care for children. The app will utilize a machine learning model to identify food items from images and provide detailed nutritional information. This information will enable health workers to offer tailored dietary advice and monitor child growth and development. By integrating a user-friendly mobile app with cloud-based infrastructure, SAHASTA will facilitate efficient data collection, analysis, and sharing, ultimately contributing to the reduction of stunting rates and the improvement of child health outcomes.
